            <h3>Devin Gyat Info</h3>

            <p>Devin is the central figure of the Koboshian Joei Truth, an ultimate being who has broken countless
                universal
                records in terms of size and still is breaking records utill this day. Devin consists of priceless
                organs
                and what he is most well known for: his extraordinary gyat. Devin gyat is so expensive that its price
                surpasses antimatter. His gyat attracts too much attention on a daily basis resulting in lots of
                touching
                and attraction. What makes his gyat so special you ask? Devin gyat has an extreme overload of nutrients
                and
                especially ribosomes. In other words, it is a superfood craved by many. Let’s say you were able to get
                your
                hands on this luxury product, the positive effects are proven to resolve all bad health aspects.
                Therefore,
                Devin gyat acts as an antidepressant, superfood, and most importantly, the “undiscovered” cure to
                cancer.
                What about Devin? He’s greedy and does not prefer to share or give back just because the nutrients he
                receives is “free”. To this day, Devin controls world hunger with cruelty turning the universe towards
                capitalism. Most of his hunger powers are directed towards the Africans because, as he has stated
                without
                joking, “I hate black people”. With common sense, you can see why he is so large. It’s because Devin
                only
                knows to consume. No wonder he has developed a natural gravitational pull. To put his gravitational pull
                into perspective, his gyat has enough force, weight to compress any object that somehow fits in between
                his
                cheeks into a hypermassive blackhole- to the astrology fans out there. In fact, Devin invented gravity
                and
                causes the shifting of tectonic plates. If you experience an earthquake or tsunami, he is within a 1
                light
                year radius. Following the shakes, Devin produces gamma rays- a high frequency and radioactive wave.
                Observing the world we live in today, there is significantly more ocean than land because he is
                releasing
                his juice and terror amongst the universal population. You may wonder why Devin gyat is so common but
                unobtainable. If you were to rub some Devin gyat sauce on your fingers, he would chase after you with
                kicks
                powered by his unimaginable weight and rusted taekwondo skills. Even if you barely approach him, he will
                start launching an attack on you because you entered his “personal space”. This is because Devin is in
                agreement with the KJT foundation that his hitbox and AOE is massive.
